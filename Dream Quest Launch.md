# 2025 Grant Development Capability Assessment & Dream Quest Launch
Greetings Everyone - Future Dream Cadets and Captains 
We are excited to announce a singular, comprehensive initiative that unifies our upcoming 2025 Dream Quest. Whether you are new to our organization or a seasoned contributor, this approach offers pathways for both Dream Cadets—our eager explorers—and Dream Captains—leaders ready to command their own orbitals.
## The Quest: Launching Dreams into Orbit!
Our mission is to construct orbitals that will evolve into entire worlds. An orbital is a structured proposal comprised of:
### Objectives
### Resources
### Budgets
### Indicators
### Transports
### Activities
### Logistics
These components align to form a self-sustaining grant or contract proposal capable of achieving lift-off and remaining stable without continuous external funding.
Dream Cadets, Captains, and Beyond
### Dream Cadets:
 New recruits who demonstrate foundational enthusiasm and skill in building ORBITAL frameworks.
### Dream Captains:
Exceptional participants who exhibit mastery and can command their own orbital.
### Dream Commanders: 
Leaders who guide multiple worlds, recognized for extensive expertise.
### Dream Chief (Mr. Hackney): 
The pinnacle authority overseeing all programs and worlds.
## Grant Development Capability Assessments
Next week, we will evaluate each candidate’s potential to become a Dream Cadet—and possibly a Dream Captain—through the Dream Capability Assessments. These 20-minute, hands-on sessions are designed for you to showcase:
### Creative Problem-Solving:
 Quickly identify and outline viable funding opportunities.
### Advanced GPT Prompting: 
Use ChatGPT to generate targeted, high-quality ORBITAL sections for your chosen grant or contract.
### ORBITAL Framework Proficiency: 
Draft comprehensive proposals that address objectives, resources, budgets, and more.
### Professional Writing & Presentation Skills:
 Present your ORBITAL-based proposal clearly, citing critical grant/contract details.
Successful participants will be fast-tracked for 2025 dream-making opportunities and may be promoted to a Dream Captain role if they demonstrate exceptional skill.
